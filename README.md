# Machine-Learning-A-Z
Hands-on portfolio based on Machine Learning Aâ€“Z: building models in Python, from regression and classification to deep learning, NLP, reinforcement learning, and dimensionality reduction. Focused on intuition, accurate predictions, and real-world business applications.

## Enviroment Setup
I use **Visual Studio Code** with my **Jupyter Notebooks** to run the projects in this repository.

### 1. Create Virtual Environment
```
python -m venv .venv

```

Activate the environment:
- Windows:
```
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

```

### 2. Install Required Libraries
Inside each notebook, I include installation instructions for the libraries used in that module.

### 3. Open Notebook in VS Code
1. Install the Python and Jupyter extensions in VS Code.
2. Select the virtual environment as the interpreter.
3. Run the notebook cells. 

## [Data Preprocessing](data_preprocessing/)

This section includes notebooks on data preprocessing: importing datasets, cleaning datasets, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, splitting into training and test sets, and applying features scaling to prepare data for machine learning models.
